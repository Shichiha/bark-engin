# about
## what is bark engine? 
bark engine is test and learning library for shichihachi

## what does it do?
it is a canvas 3d library (it uses the 2d context) that draws points  
maybe i will take it upon me to make a fully working engine with game support such as builtin gravity system and collision detection  

maybe i will also add triangle and quad support
